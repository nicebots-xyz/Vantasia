**Section 1: Service Description**

"Our service ('the Service'), provided by Nicebots.xyz ('we', 'us', 'our'), is designed to generate 'best-of' timelines compatible with Final Cut Pro 7 and Adobe Premiere from YouTube streams. This is achieved by processing the audio of the video through speech-to-text (STT) algorithms and then employing a large language model (LLM) to intelligently detect and title the most interesting moments of the stream. The output is an OTIO timeline that users can utilize within compatible video editing software. Please note, our Service requires the stream to be compatible with the aforementioned editing platforms."
